Lab Assignment Rachel Li

Lab 1 
I created a deep sea scene with some seaweed, a shark and a little fish.
I made a deep sea background as my main scene and also create a seaweed scene.
I don't have questions during the assignment. Everything works well.

Lab 2 
I made a grey cat moving by press  up, down, right, and left keys.
Also I exported the speed.
